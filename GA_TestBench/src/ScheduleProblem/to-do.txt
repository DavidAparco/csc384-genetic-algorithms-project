potential problems:

- timing: need a time format in timing class, 
at least we should change time = rand.nextInt(numTimes) to be a time that 0 <= time < 24

- need to input day intervals?

- need to input room size?  or an alternative way is to see if the room is jammed, if 
yes, will decrease the evaluated scores.
